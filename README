This code explores using sbt-lauch to automatically download a program and its dependences and run it.

hello.project - The source code for a simple hello-world project
hello.deploy - Where the code is deployed and run

This assumes there is a local repo for storing jars.


Running the Hello Example

- cd to hello.project and run sbt. Do a "run" to verify it says "Hello, World", then do a publish to push it to the repo.
- cd to hello.deploy
